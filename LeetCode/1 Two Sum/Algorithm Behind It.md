**Optimization DSA Behind It:**
- **`vector<int>`**
    - Access elements by index: `nums[i]`
- **`unordered_map`**
    - Key → value lookup in **O(1)**
    - Store: number → index
- **For loop**
    - Single pass through the array
- **Basic arithmetic**
    - Compute: `needed = target - nums[i]`
- **Big-O idea (very basic)**
    - Know that **O(n)** is better than **O(n²)**
